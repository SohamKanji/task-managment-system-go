**Work in progress**

Currently, the goal is to:

1. CRUD APIs for tasks (Creating a task, getting a task by its id, getting all tasks, updating a task, deleting a task).
2. A task has the following properties : Due data, Status ("open", "in progress", "done"), Priority ("low", "medium", "high"), Title and Description.
